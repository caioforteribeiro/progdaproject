    "<p>In the Autumn of 1948, a pioneer study on risk factors associated with developing heart disease kickstarted in the small town of Framingham, Massachussetts. Despite being the cause of roughly half of the deaths in the US in the early 1940's, cardiovascular disease was still poorly understood in terms of prevention and treatment [1]. So much so that some argue that even the then US President, Frankling D. Roosevelt could have lived longer if only his first signs of cardiovascular disease have been detected earlier [1].The Framingham Heart Study aimed at filling that knowledge gap and investigated which factors (behavioural, physiological, demographic etc) were playing a part in the development of heart disease.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In its first round, the study evaluated health parametres of 5,209 residents of the town, such as their dietary, exercising, and smoking habits, blood pressure, heart rate, age, and history of underlying conditions (e.g. diabetes, and/or strokes).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>When the results of the study were published nine years later, in 1957, it was the first time that tobacco consumption, obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure were linked with a higher risk of someone developing cardiovascular disease [2]. Since then, the study was granted funding for additional rounds, evaluating these and other parametres among the children and grandchildren of the original cohorts. It is still being conducted to this day, having gathered and analysed epidemiological data from more than 15,000 individuals from three generations for more than 70 years [3].</p>"

Not only that, but the risk of developing heart disease increases significantly according to the number of cigarettes a person smokes per day. For instance, someone who smokes a pack of cigarettes every day (i.e. 20 cigarettes per day) has twice the chance of developing heart disease compared to a non-smoker [6].</p>"

    "Real-world data from the Framingham study indicate that out of their 5,209 people sample, most smoked up to 5 cigarettes a day, with another peak at between 15 and 20 cigarettes per day. Very few people smoked a number of cigarettes outside of these parametres. To emulate this, we made approximations for observations above 10 cigarettes per day, considering only 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and then 40, 50, 60, and 70 (our values for `a`). Per se, the number of cigarettes one can smoke in a day cannot be considered [discrete data](https://www.thedrum.com/profile/whatagraph/news/discrete-vs-continuous-data-whats-the-difference#:~:text=Discrete%20data%20is%20a%20count,%2C%20and%20non%2Dnegative%20integers.), as one can smoke half or 3/4 of a cigarette every day. We looked at it as dicrete only to simplify our probabilities (`p`) - otherwise, we'll end up with a non-unifom distributed array of 70 random probabilities which does not correspond to the data observed in the real-world."

    "Again, here we simplified real-world observations and considered that cholesterol levels follow a normal distribution centred around 237 and with a stardard deviation of about 45 (values taken from the description of the original dataset). However, we noticed that cholesterol levels are all integers (discrete data), whist `np.random.normal()` would return an array of floats. A workaround - not ideal, but sufficient for our purpose - was to round the random array to have only integers in our variable `chol`. We did that using `np.round()` \\[10\\]\\[11\\]."

We also know that BMI is continuous data, so it accepts floats as values, that our data had a max value of 56.8 (`upper`), a min of 15.54 (`lower`), a mean of 25 (`mu`), and a std of 4.08 (`sigma`).\n",
