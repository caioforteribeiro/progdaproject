    "<p>In the Autumn of 1948, a pioneer study on risk factors associated with developing heart disease kickstarted in the small town of Framingham, Massachussetts. Despite being the cause of roughly half of the deaths in the US in the early 1940's, cardiovascular disease was still poorly understood in terms of prevention and treatment [1]. So much so that some argue that even the then US President, Frankling D. Roosevelt could have lived longer if only his first signs of cardiovascular disease have been detected earlier [1].The Framingham Heart Study aimed at filling that knowledge gap and investigated which factors (behavioural, physiological, demographic etc) were playing a part in the development of heart disease.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In its first round, the study evaluated health parametres of 5,209 residents of the town, such as their dietary, exercising, and smoking habits, blood pressure, heart rate, age, and history of underlying conditions (e.g. diabetes, and/or strokes).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>When the results of the study were published nine years later, in 1957, it was the first time that tobacco consumption, obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure were linked with a higher risk of someone developing cardiovascular disease [2]. Since then, the study was granted funding for additional rounds, evaluating these and other parametres among the children and grandchildren of the original cohorts. It is still being conducted to this day, having gathered and analysed epidemiological data from more than 15,000 individuals from three generations for more than 70 years [3].</p>"
