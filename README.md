## About this repository

This repository contains one Jupyter notebook (`simulation.ipynb`) and related data required to run the notebook, as part of the assessment for the module *Programming for Data Analysis* at GMIT. All code was written in Python ([v. 3.8.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/), realeased on Feb 19, 2021).

## Task
Create a dataset that simulates a real-world phenomenon using Python and implement this simulation in a Jupyter notebook. The data should be synteshised and mimic the properties of real (or supposed) data for the chosen phenomenon.

In this project, we simulated the risk factors associated with heart disease, as presented in the [*Framingham Heart Disease Study*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study) from 1948.

## Summary
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, heart disease was topping the WHO list of main causes of deaths globally [1]. In the late 1940's, it was the cause of 1 in every 2 deaths in the US, motivating a systematic, long-term study that became known as the Framingham Heart Disease Study, after the name of the town where it has been conducted since 1948.[2] The study showed, for the first time, that a number of behavioural, physiological, and demographic factors were associated with a greater risk of a person developing heart disease later in life.[3]
